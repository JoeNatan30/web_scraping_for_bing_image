# webscrapping_for_bing_image
This repository features scripts for practicing web scraping (R and Python) and GUI development (Python). It demonstrates how to scrape data and integrate it into a GUI for comparing scraped images with search terms, aiding in image verification and analysis.

# Notes
- R may not be essential for this project.
- Alternative libraries for retrieving images from links are available, but I used the chosen one due to installation constraints.
